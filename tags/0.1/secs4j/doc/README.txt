Introduction
------------

The secs4j project offers an open source SECS/GEM library written in Java.

The SECS/GEM protocol is the defacto standard in the semiconductor industry used for communication
between the host system and semiconductor equipment. 

The secs4j library strives to comply with the following SEMI standards:
* SEMI E05 SECS-II
* SEMI E30 GEM
* SEMI E37 HSMS


Status
------

Basic SECS/GEM communication has been implemented, but far more work is required to at least
comply with the minimal set of implementation requirements set by the related SEMI standards.


Development
-----------

This Java project has a Maven structure.

Recommended tools are Eclipse with the Subversive and m2eclipse plugins.
